# Leetcode_Brush_Questions_Everyday
### 考研成功上岸，毕业论文也已写完，突然闲下来感觉身体上和精神上都受不了，正好趁此机会提高提高自己的编程能力。虽然以前学过c，python，但是自以为写的代码太少了，而且考研一年完全没有练习。我以后会每天把在leetcode上完成代码和解题心得上传到githup，希望可以帮助到他人，也以此督促我不要偷懒。

### I successfully went ashore for the postgraduate entrance examination and finished my graduation thesis. I suddenly felt unbearable physically and mentally when I was free. I just took this opportunity to improve my programming ability. Although I have learned c and python before, I thought I wrote too little code, and I didn't practice at all for one year after the postgraduate entrance examination. I will upload the completed code and problem solving experience on leetcode to githup every day, hoping to help others, and to urge me not to be lazy.
